# "Galaxy News" - News Reader App

A news reader app that allows the user to search The Guardian Online's news stories to display relevant news. In-app preferences allows for the selected article to be viewed in app or opened in an external browser, as well as setting the search term and number of search results.

The news reader shows a list of articles that contain the user's search term. The search term can be set in the app settings. Initially, the app shows 10 results sorted by relevance, but both of these can also be adjusted via the settings. The news reader app will open the Guardian article either in a WebKit activity in app, or open an external browser on the user's device.
