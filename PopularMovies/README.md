# Popular Movies

## Stage 1
Created the basic functionality of the app that requests the top rated or most popular movies on TMDb.org's site. JSON was parsed to show the movie poster in a grid, and to display additional information about the movie in a separate details activity when the user clicks on a movie poster.

## Stage 2
Functionality to mark favourites and have them stored in a local database was added to the app, as well as the ability to watch trailers or read movie reviews on the details page.
