# UdacityProjects

## Android Basics

While I work through the Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree program, there are 6 projects that are required for completion of the Nanodegree. All the projects are collected here instead of being given their own repository. A brief description of each project follows below:

### Project 1: Single Screen App - Sharmoli Software Solutions
This project is a basic, single screen info app for a ficticious company. Displays text and icons pertaining to opening and close hours, contact information, and a brief bio of the company.

### Project 2: ScoreKeeper
This project is a simple scorekeeper app for a baseball game. Allows entry of team names and tracking the inning as well as runs, hits and walks. for each team. Team at bat is highlighted by selecting inning half from a radio button.

### Project 3: QuizBowl App
A simple single-screen activity quiz app. Radio buttons, check boxes, text entry input checked for quiz answers. Get a score out of four when you test your knowledge of Canadian and US history.

### Project 4: Podcast Player (Musical Structure App)
A simple multi-screen activity that builds the structure of a podcast and audiobook player. Uses multiple activities to display the currently playing media file, information about a selected media file, or to add a new media file to the list. Note: Does not actually play or load audio files.

### Project 5: Tour Guide App
A multi-screen activity that highlights several places to eat, drink, visit or sleep when visiting Toronto. Each attraction has its own information page that allows the user to call the attraction, visit its website, or get driving directions from google maps to the attraction.


### Project 6: NewsReader App
A news reader app that allows the user to search The Guardian Online's news stories to display relevant news. In-app preferences allows for the selected article to be viewed in app or opened in an external browser, as well as setting the search term and number of search results.

## Android Developer

### Popular Movies, Stage 1 and 2
This app uses TheMovieDatabase.org's API to fetch the top 20 most popular and the top 20 top rated movies on their website and displays the movie poster in a Grid layout. The user's able to click on a movie poster to pull up a details page that shows some information about the movie and allows the user to watch movie trailers and read reviews of the movies. The user's able to mark a movie as favourite and have it stored in a local movies database.
