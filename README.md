# UdacityProjects

While I work through the Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree program, there are 8 projects that are required for completion of the Nanodegree. All the projects are collected here instead of being given their own repository. A brief description of each project follows below:

This project is a basic, single screen info app for a ficticious company. Displays text and icons pertaining to opening and close hours, contact information, and a brief bio of the company.

### Project 2: ScoreKeeper
This project is a simple scorekeeper app for a baseball game. Allows entry of team names and tracking the inning as well as runs, hits and walks. for each team. Team at bat is highlighted by selecting inning half from a radio button.
