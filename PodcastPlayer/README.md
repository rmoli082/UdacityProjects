# "Multimedia Player" - Podcast Player (Musical structure app)

A simple multi-screen activity that builds the structure of a podcast and audiobook player. Uses multiple activities to display the currently playing media file, information about a selected media file, or to add a new media file to the list. Note: Does not actually play or load audio files.

The player holds a list of fictional media files, and allows the user to click on a media file to play it. If the user long presses on the media file it will bring up the media information screen. The Now Playing bar at the bottom can be clicked on which opens to a larger Now Playing screen that has a set of media controls that are determined by media type. On the main screen, a floating action button allows the user to "add" a new media file to the list.
