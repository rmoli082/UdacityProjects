# Tour Guide Activity

A multi-screen activity that highlights several places to eat, drink, visit or sleep when visiting Toronto. Each attraction has its own information page that allows the user to call the attraction, visit its website, or get driving directions from Google Maps to the attraction.

The Tour Guide app uses a tabbed fragment layout that allows the user to scroll through a list of places they can visit, eat, drink or sleep at when they visit Toronto. Each tab provides a list of attractions that the user can click on which will bring up an information page for the attraction. The attraction details page will allow the user to call the attraction, visit its website, or to get driving directions to the attraction using the user's current location as provided by Google Maps.

An Attraction abstract class was created and extended to house differing information about each of the attraction categories: Tourist Spot, Restaurant, or Hotel.
